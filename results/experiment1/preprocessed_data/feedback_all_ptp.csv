sub_007,"Yes, the instructions were clear.","No, I didn't notice this.",I noticed that the pictures moved each time.,I noticed that some picture moved but couldn't say which ones.,I noticed that the picture changed around.,I tried to learn where each picture was within the coloured box and ignored the visible pictures as I found them distracting.,I found that the visible pictures hindered me so tried to ignore them.,A progress bar would have been helpful. Or something to say how many rounds I had left to do.
sub_008,Yes.,Yes.,Yes.,Yes.,Yes.,"On earlier boards, I tried to learn the locations relative to the visual pictures. In the middle few boards I learned some relative to the pictures and others relative to the background square. In the last board I tried to visualise an axis on the board. ","Helped to a point. Only the first two boards were completely healpful. The third board was useful for learning some of the locations. After this, the pictures were not useful, but not a distraction either. The final board was more difficult.",N/A

sub_012,"Very clear, easy to understand.","I believe the blue board was one of my more successful boards, and found it fairly simple on second attempt.",I did not notice.,"The red board was one of the more difficult for me to remember, and I wasn't feeling like I were closer to understanding it even after my second attempt.","Yes, I did notice and I struggled the most with this board.","The last board was the easiest due to no visible pictures throwing me off and the patterns were not changed. With the other boards my strategy was to just try and remember what visible pictures were close by the hidden pictures and play off that. Which is why I struggled with the yellow board the most, as that strategy would not work.","They hindered me on the yellow board. The last board was the easiest, so I would say they hindered me overall more than actually helping me.","I enjoyed my experience, I can't think of anything right now that could have improved my participation. Thank you."
sub_013,All instructions were clear,Yes,Yes,No,No,I tended to ignore the visible pictures all together and try to split the box up into  grid of smaller squares in my mind and try to remember where on the grid the hidden pictures were,I did not really take notice of the visible pictures at all on the boards where images moved. I noticed the visible pictures on the static board and this did help slightly when picturing some of the hidden images,No
sub_014,they were clear,yes ,no - i just thought they moved around randomly,no,yes,"my strategy was to remember the locations relative to the centre, it stayed the same for all boards","visible [pictures hindered me. i thought it was much easier without them, they were a distraction",no

sub_018,yes,yes,no,no,no,"no, maybe should have tho!",helped,no
sub_019,The instructions were clear.,No,No,No,No,"I had the same strategy for every board, which was to try and ignore the visible pictures and remember the hidden pictures independently of them.",I think I did the best on the boards with no visible pictures so I guess that means the visible pictures hindered me.,No
sub_020,Yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,"trying to ignore the moving visible pictures and focus on locations of hidden objects, same for each board","initially hinder, then help.",nope. it was fun. good luck with the research.

sub_022,Instructions were clear for all stages.,Yes I noticed this on the blue board.,Yes I noticed they had changed on the green board.,Yes I did notice this change but I was concentrating more on where the new images were appearing so I could remember this.,Yes I did notice this.,I used the strategy of just squaring with my fingers in the screen of the exact location for each new item so I could remember it.,"I think the visible pictures helped when they stayed in one spot, but it did not help that the images were changing around in the other trials and this made it more difficult to find and remember the item.",The one thing is the screen size.  This trial should be made to fit the screen and not have me make adjustments to my screen.  The screen becoming smaller to fit the trial made it harder to see the objects on the screen because they became a lot smaller.
sub_023,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,Just tried to remember them according to north south east west,visible pictures were distracting,N/a
sub_024,yes they were clear,Yes,Yes,I noticed movement of pictures but couldn't have identified that pattern.,Yes,I sometimes tried to split the square up as though it were a clock face.  I don't feel it gave me great success though.,"I felt it depended on the board, but sometimes, yes.",none
sub_025,Yes,Yes,I noticed that on a board or two the locations changed but can't remember which colour was that board.,Not particularly so that I can name what was moved and what was fixed,No,"I was trying to learn the location with respect to the size of the board. I was trying to divide the board in half and draw some imaginary lines and compare with respect to those that was my main strategy. Initially I was trying to use other pictures, in the first few boards I was trying to use the location of the visible pictures as cue, but that seemed harder with the visible pictures changing and their location changing as well. So I changed strategy and decided to learn the locations with respect to the middle of the board (horizontally and vertically) and this was easier.","Hinder me, didn't like them very much, the board that didn't have the visible pictures (I think it was the purple board) was the easiest/best. Shame my PC froze for a second and I missed some of the trials on that board.","The location was extremely sensitive, I hope you calculate the distance from where I clicked to where the object was rather than the correct and incorrect feedbacks. Probably more than 90% of the time I was clicking very very close, some of which I might have missed by a single pixel, seriously, it was too sensitive to the exact location of the items."
sub_026,"Yes, all clear","Yes, I did notice. I think I did the best on that one ","Yes, I noticed that they swapped but not with every trial","Nope, did not notice ","Yes, did notice ","I think I kinda did, especally for the blue one as they stayed in the same location.","somtimes it did and somtimes it did not. For the blue one it did, however the yellow one did not.","Maybe,tell you how many trails you have on each board eg 1/24 "
sub_027,"Perfectly clear, yes",No,No,Yes,No,I mentally drew boxes and put the images on the lines where they met,"I didn't think they helped, I wasn't paying them too much attention, but the purple board without them seemed a little harder maybe","No further feedback, thank you"
sub_028,All clear,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,I tried ignoring constant pictures because they were distracting. Only for last one I linked the two types together ,Hinder in most cases ,no

sub_032,"I thought when I would enter full screen mode everything will be shown on screen, it may be an error with my laptop that did not show my scroll bar so I could have typed the names of the visible objects in the visible box, which I apologise the visible objects did however load on each game without issue",I did,I did,I think so,Yes,"Tried to have a rough mapped out area, IE beer bottle near top left corner approx 1 inch down etc","Hinder me, I found the best performance was when there were no visible pictures at all, I believe I had a much better accuracy rate, I believe this could be due to no visual distraction and allowed me to visualise the hidden objects much better.","No thanks, this was very fun to be a part of :)"

Maybe double the amount of traing needed as i did not feel i was ready the first few boards. Even after reading the instructions carefully.

Thanks for the opportunity."
sub_036,yes,i think so,"probably, but i was not focus on that sapect.",no,no,visualised quadrants and placed the image by corner,i think they hinder me on all of them,none
sub_037,Yes very clear,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,I tried to focus on where the objects were relative to the square rather than the visible pictures,Hindered a bit especially when the visible ones kept moving,None
sub_038,Instructions were clear.,No,Yes,No,Yes,Just tried to remember the hidden pictures' location against the coloured background.,The visible pictures hindered just by being there. It did not depend on whichever board.,Interesting experiment/game. Thank you
sub_039,yes,I'm not sure,I think so?,"I didn't count the number but yes, I spotted that some stayed the same",I think so?,"Ignore the visible pictures, and try to conceptualise their relative positions to each other.",They were easy to ignore after I did the purple board and realised it was nicer to do without the visible pictures.,No
sub_040,"Yes I think they were fairly clear, I'm just not sure if the board was supposed to have a grid or not.","If that was the first one, yes I noticed that they stayed the same.","Yes, I noticed the pictures moved but it was always the same squares occupied.","No, I didn't notice that pattern.","Yes, it was very hard.",Roughly trying to remember locations but the more items I was introduced to in subsequent boards I started to get more confused,Hindered me when the relationships didn't make sense in relation to the other objects (hard to remember with an association). But by the end it was just pointless anyway because of all the movement.,I surprisingly found it very frustrating more than most tasks I've taken part in.  I think it is because it wasn't even noticing when I was close.  without a grid it was very difficult and often I was just shy of clicking on it but was still 'incorrect'.  I found the frustration distracting in the end.
sub_041,They were clear.,Yes.,Yes.,Yes.,Yes.,"Depending on the board, some I tried to remember which picture they were next to, others I tried to remember the exact location.","I felt that with the green board I performed the best, so I think they did hinder me in some trials. However in some trials they were beneficial as they were placed next to the hidden ones, which made it easier to locate the exact position.",No.
sub_042,yes,yes,no,no,yes,"the ones that stayed in the same position were easy, others were impossible",hinder me,none
sub_043,yes they were clear,no,no,no,no,not really just tried remembering them I felt blue was the easiest though,I felt like the one with no pictures was harder for some reason,No it was fine I hope you find what you are looking for
sub_044,Yes,Yes,"I noticed there was movement, but not that they swapped places.","I noticed there was movement, but not specifically.",Yes,"On the blue board, I used the other images to help remember. Otherwise, I grouped hidden images together based on their location on the board.","The blue board was easiest, because they didn't move. The purple board was second easiest, because there was no images. The rest were trickier because the moving images interfered with my perception of where the hidden images were.",No.
sub_045,Everything was clear.,Yes.,Only slightly noticed.,"I was suspicious of this one, but couldn't figure it out.",Yes. It made things very difficult.,I mostly tried to remember the spacial location of each hidden object.,It seemed to depend on the board. The earlier ones seemed far more helpful than the later ones.,Not at this time.
sub_046,all clear,yes i noticed,yes i noticed,I didnt really pic this up,yes I noticed,tried to memorise by how many blocks up and to the side,i think they helped (definitely in the static one they did),"no, it was good and challenging"

sub_055,The instructions were clear and understandable.,No,Yes,No,Yes,I tried to link the pictures together for example the microwave and coach pictures in the last trial looked very similar to one another. ,"Sometimes they helped, sometimes they through me off.

sub_056,Yes.,Yes.,Yes.,No.,Yes.,"Generally I just tried to memorise the location of each item with relating it to anything else.

sub_058,"Yes, very clear.",Yes.,No.,No.,Yes.,"On the blue board (when the images did not move) I was able to calibrate the location of the hidden images based on the visible images, which helped. On the other boards I didn't have a strategy as such (at least not one I was aware of).","It depended on the board I was learning on. If the visible pictures changed every time they were a hinderance (as they just added confusion and made it harder to focus) whereas when they were stable, I could use them as an anchor for the hidden images.",The feedback only just made it onto my screen so perhaps this could be located more centrally in future.

sub_060,They were all clear.,No.,No.,No.,No.,"Kind of. I started off by trying to learn the ones toward the outside of the square (normally two of them). I found them a lot easier to remember/place. I'd then try and learn the locations of the middle placed ones one by one. Once I'd mastered three of the positions, I'd then try and learn a fourth, etc. ","I'd probably say hinder. I found the one without the pictures (I think it was purple) probably the easiest, although by the end, I felt like I had gotten quite good at doing it with the pictures, so maybe I just needed to get used to it? What board it was didn't really matter to me at all if I'm being honest. ","The break feedback text could be improved. I couldn't tell if you wanted me to have a two minute break, or whether you were just offering me up that as an option if I wanted it. "
