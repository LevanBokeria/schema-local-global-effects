sub_004,Yes they were all clar,yes i noticed this,I recognised this towards the end,yes,Yes i thought this was the case,"I used the square grid to help me work out the distances of the hidden pictures from the edge of the square to help locate it. The same applied with working out the distance of the hidden pictures from the static visible pictures. This strategy worked across the board in the most part, but having to adapt to random movement","Yes, as stated above the visible pictures provided markers for me to work out how many 'squares' I was from a hidden image",None that i can think of; thank you
sub_005,"Yes, instruction were clear",yes,No,no,No,I try to remeber the location of each picture ,It helped alot while i was learning the locations of hidden pictures ,no
sub_006,They seemed pretty clear to me,Maybe?,Yes,I only noticed a couple that didn't move,I  noticed 3 that didn't move,Try to find the best 'reference' visible pictures i.e ones that did not move and were somewhere I deemed noteworthy relative to the hidden pictures.,"The more visible pictures that didn't move, the better, although that isn't really saying much with how badly I did!","None that wouldn't compromise the results of the test in some capacity, I'm sure."
sub_007,"yes, once i started it was easy to follow",no i didn't!,yes,yeah,yes!,i tried to work out which image stayed the same location on each round and used that as a focus point,"it depended on the board, the 4 images were a lot harder than 6!",no
sub_008,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes I made picture clues to help me identify the places,they kind of help in most cases,no
sub_009,Yes!,Yes,Yes,No,No,"I tried to remember the ones adjacent to the visible, stationary pictures. I also had a strategy for remembering that some images were above and some below e.g. pants were below and they're also lower on your body, whereas the cloud was higher up ","The stationary pictures helped, as I would remember which hidden pictures were nearby. It was more confusing with more pictures.",I would suggest having a bigger board on the screen!
sub_010,Yes,Yes,Yes,"I generally focussed on 2 that didn't move, I didn't notice if any others stayed","Again, I focussed on 2 that didn't move so I didn't notice if there were more than that","I looked at the pictures that didn't move and if any hidden pictures were next to them I remembered that. Then I just remembered the location of the hidden pictures roughly according to the square (top left, middle, bottom right etc)","The stable pictures helped me, but the ones that moved randomly did not help, I just dismissed them.",None
sub_011,i wasnt sure how i could name the photos that were visible when iwasnt shown them,no,yeah,no,no,"just said in my head what those objects were near or their basic location, e.g stairs were in the top left corner, or onion was below the table etc",they helped when there was 5-6 but when there were more it made it more difficult,no - thank you.
sub_012,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,I split the grid into 9 sections in my head and assigned the hidden pictures to each grid,Didn't help or hinder,na

sub_019,Yes very clue,"Indeed, once I noticed it made the exercise much easier","Yes, I found this helpful",No,"Yes, it helped me orientate my cursor.","Yes, I remember where hidden pictures were in relation to static visible ones",Almost always help.,"No. I felt I could reliably get close, if not exact, so could be worth tracking"
sub_020,Yes the instructions were clear,"Yes, I believe they stayed in the same place each time.","I noticed that some were moving, although wans't sure of how many moved.","Again I realised that some moved, but did not noticed how many did","Noticed that some moved, but did not know how many","I tried to learn where the pictures were in relation to the board as a whole, because I felt that the visible pictures would not be reliable enough to depend on.  For most I tried to remember the pictures with relation to the whole square, although for some I did base it on the static images once I was confident in them.","Sometimes the visible pictures helped, but overall I tried to ignore most of them and focus on where the hidden pictures were in the sqaure as a whole.","No specific feedback, thank you for the chance to participate."
sub_021,yes,yes,no,no,no,"I tried to focus on the middle of the coloured square, apart from the blue board as I noticed that the locations were fixed, so I tried to remember them.",I expected the visible pictures on the blue board to help but I think it actually hindered and I think focussing on the centre of each coloured square was more useful.,n/a
sub_022,yes,no,no,no,no,I tried to match the hidden pictures to a visible item and place it somewhere near it in my head,they usually helped as i could try to associate the images in my mind though they moved at times so it wasnt always easy,no
sub_023,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,I learned where the stable images where and the location of the hidden images to them. I also learned the approximate location from the edge or centre of the hidden images,"Helped, allowed me to use them as markers",None

I'm not sure how to make it clearer, though.",no,no,no,no,"I tried to picture the square with a grid to then try to remember their ""coordinates""; I used the same overall strategy for each board, but sometimes I envisioned halves, thirds, or quadrants.","I don't think they really aided me in any way, especially because I hadn't noticed some of them kept their location. I focused more on the above strategy.","The pictures are tiny, even in full screen, which makes it quite hard to discern, and also requires one to be quite precise when clicking on where one things the object is. Is this intentional toward the aim of the experiment, or is it just practical logistical requirement for the nature of the study (not enough space, basically)? I feel like if it is a case of the latter, the size/exactness required might skew results."
sub_028,yes,yes,no,no,no,My strategy was to try and see where they were on the bored roughly and remember that. ,They helped only on the blue bored. ,Sometimes it looked like i clicked the picture but it came up as missed

sub_031,yes,yes,"pretty sure, yes",yes,not sure but think so,"in the blue board I mostly tried to focus on the visible pictures and take them as a focal point to determine the hidden one. with all the other boards, I entirely focused on the positioning of the boards themselves and the rough distances between the borders of the boards and locations of the hidden objects rather than the visible objects which were distracting with their constant movement.","helped on the blue board with them not moving at all, hindered my process in all other cases and made me rely on the boards themselves and their positioning more.",no
sub_032,Clear enough.,Didn't notice at the time.,Did not notice this.,Did not notice.,Did not notice,"intially I tried to memorise simply by saying the name of the object and it's location out loud (e.g. cloud, centre left), then I tried to think of where they were in the real world (e.g. on the third board I would say ""ceiling fan on the roof"" as it was where you would expect it, however this has limited advantages especially when the bulb was ""on the floor""!. By the last board I made an invisible link between each one as they came, I remembered the first was just below centre and then the wheel was to it's right, then the wasp was about up left of this, stair was up left of this, cloud was down from it, and jeans was down-right from this and therefore close to the first object, and so the cycle continued. I imagine I scored best on this last puzzle as this strategy seemed to work for me and I was always close.","Didn't matter as I didn't really use them, I just imagined where the hidden pictures were in isolation. Which is why my answers to the above are that I didn't notice the patterns in the visible pictures.",Allow an extra second to make mind up.
sub_033,yes,yes,no,no,no,"i linked some images to locations e.g. on purple board, stairs lead to the top, it was top left",on the blue board but not the others,no

sub_038,Yes was clear but the task was incredibly difficult ,Yes,Yes,I only noticed that some moved and some stayed ,I only noticed that lots seemed to be changing.,"I tried to memorise pictures that were near each other as a group, together, but it was not very successful because I could only learn a few of the pictures this way","They definitely helped me,  as I tried to learn locations based on other pictures, but this did also hinder my performance when they moved around.","It was really difficult so to improve performance, making the pictures bigger would be better because I often knew the general area where the hidden picture was but failed to click on the exact spot. Please also see your prolific messages about why my completion time seemed to short! It filled in with the wrong code from another study. Thanks"

I tried to imagine the grid the pictures were on and worked out their position from the nearest corner, eg 3 up, 3 across, for the Jeans in the fourth trial",Maybe make it clearer that you would have to learn the position of the pictures at the beginning of each block. In the instructions it wasn't clear that you would get the first few wrong whilst you learnt each position
sub_040,they were clear,yes,yes,no,no,trying to remember previous location ,"sometimes helped, other times they were distracting",maybe increase it to 4 secs from 3
sub_041,yes very,yep,yes,yes,no,I tried to anchor them to one of the pictures that remained still - or the edges of the board,it depended,no
sub_042,I felt that the instruction were clear.,"Yes, and I think I did better there than on the others.","Yes, which did help somewhat.","Yes, I did notice that too.","Yes, I did.","Generally, if they were next to a picture that stayed, click there, other than that, work out the distance between the picture and the nearest edge.","It depended on the board. Some of them it did, other times it tricked me.",Nope!
sub_043,Yes,No,No,No,No,To figure out the overall area of where they fell and then I could ignore the outer areas from that in hope to try keep things in a tight circle of locations,"I don't think they did either, I used my memory to try pinpont the locations ",No
sub_044,"No, everything was clear.",Yes,Yes,I'm not sure.,I'm not sure.,"I tried to identify which hidden images were always next to certain images. That made it a lot easier to look out for the visible images and try and remember where they were. For the other images, I tried to remember where they were in relation to edges of the square. This was a lot easier when there were other visible images in the same place every time, as I could use these as points of reference.","Once I knew which ones were relevant this was useful (e.g. which ones had hidden images next to them). Also, on boards where the images stayed in fixed positions, the visible images provided useful points of reference. I ignored them when they kept changing direction though.","No thank you.

This looks like really interesting research though. I hope that it goes well."
sub_045,all clear,yes,yes,yes,no,no ,hinder me,all good
sub_046,they were clear enough,i did,i did,i did,i did not,compare with the border and the visable images,"help, but some helped more than others",none

sub_053,"Yeah, they were very clear and not unnecessarily wordy and needlessly complicated like instructions on some studies",I didn't,I didn't ,I didn't ,I didn't,"For most of the study I was paying more attention to the overall position as I found that a little easier than focusing on the visual objects, though I still missed a lot. For the last one I tried paying a bit more attention to the visible objects and actually it did help a little","I thought they were hindering me to begin with, although they did seem to help a little near the end, but either way it was hard to click in the exact position, especially as there wasn't even grids or anything",I think the images could be bigger so people didn't have to zoom in so much but otherwise was great 
sub_054,Yes they were,Yes,No,Yes,No,"Not really, if a hidden picture was next to a visible picture I would try to remember where",Definitely helped on boards where some visible pictures stayed the same,No thank you
sub_055,"yeah pretty much, the only thing I'd say, is I weirdly thought I'd see the pictures that where in hidden in the general areas before we started and thought I was missing something. ",yes,no,no,no,"corners in general areas, I tried to get them in the right place",bit of both ,Give us a little bit of le-way. I clicked a pixel off and failed some haha
sub_056,They were clear,No - not at all!,Nope,No,Yes,I didn't use the visible pictures as positional aids at all after the purple board; I found it easier to imagine rectangles of various shapes and sizes to determine how far away the hidden images were from the board's edges.,"I felt they they were distracting. After the first board, where I tried to use the fixed images, I settled on the strategy described above.",No - it was hard though!
sub_057,Yes they were clear,No!,No!,No!,No!,"I imagined the board was divided into squares, like the battleship game, and would assign each hidden picture with a code as accurately as i could. I would then attempt to replicate that code (e.g. B3) when guessing their position.",Neither,No
sub_058,they were clear. I properly understood the rules on the 2nd trial.,"did not notice that all stayed at the same location, but noticed most subconsciously. the kiwi I did notice for sure.",yes,I noticed that a few remained the same.,no,just tried to see how far they are from center and the edges.,I found the blue one the easiest to determine the correct location,no

sub_065,Yes,I think this was explained in the instructions.,No.,No.,No.,"Yes, I came up with stories, mnemonics and spatial relationships between the pictures and their position on the board. I used the same strategy from the second board onwards. On the first board I didn't have a strategy.",They neither helped nor hindered.,"If you're not recording near-misses, that seems like it would give you more of an idea of how well someone is doing, rather than a correct/incorrect result. Tracking improving accuracy even when not hitting the target."
sub_066,"They were clear, but I was slightly confused at the start as I didn't know how I was going to be able to guess where the hidden images were without any other information. I didn't know I'd learn by repeating the same images until I was doing it.",No,No,No,No,"I would just try to visualize where the pictures were, sometimes in comparison to the overall box and sometimes relative to the other pictures. That was the same strategy I used for all boards.",They helped me with spacial awareness off the scale of the box and the distances between pictures.,No
sub_067,yes they were clear,no,no,no,no,"yes, i tried to split the board visually into thirds horizontally and then would split the board vertically down the middle and try to remember which was in which area.

sub_068,"Yes, There was clear and concise language used and each stage was explained thoroughly",Yes,No,No,No,I simply tried to use photographic memory to remember the precise location of each hidden object on the board. I actually ignored the visible pictures as I viewed them as a distraction.,They hindered me as it was more information to process. It was much easier if I focused only on the hidden objects.,"Not off the top of my head, but I found it enjoyable and a bit of a challenge."
sub_069,yes,"Yes, that one was a little easier than the others. ","Sort of, i was too focused on finding the hidden pictures. ","I did not notice, it seemed like they was all moving around. ","This one i felt very difficult, i did not realise as there was more pictures on the screen.

For example, remember that ceiling fan is near the top of the board because ceiling fans are on top of the ceiling. Or remember that the football is near is the bottom of the board because a ball fell to the ground. 

I also tried to make pairings for closely-spaced pictures. For example, the wasp flies near the cloud. Or jeans are near the bike. 

I also split the board into parts and labelled them. For example, ""cloud is middle top"", or, ""football is left bottom""","I think they sometimes helped me to align my cursor to the image. For example sometimes I had a general idea of where to click, but then used to visible image as a reference to increase my accuracy.

I don't feel like the visible images provided real drawbacks for me. I felt that I could ignore/block out the irrelevant moving images from my mind. ",No
sub_076,Yes - clear instructions,No,No,No,No,I tried to word associate and make connections where I could - such as imagining the squirrel eating the pumpkin it was above. But I couldn't make connections quickly enough for all of them.,I noticed the pictures moving around the boards but I didn't notice the specific patterns listed above. I was too focused on the task itself. Sometimes I was only a hair width out of the target area which was a bit frustrating!,No. Thank you for letting me take part in this experiment.

sub_094,Yes,"Yes, and it made it easier to find the hidden ones",Yes,No,No,"I tried to remember roughly how far from the left and right, plus top and bottom to try to locate them",It helped depending on the board and whether they stayed fixed as you could fix the hidden pictures easier,It was fun and I enjoyed doing it

sub_098,No it took until the first task until i realised what was asked. It would be better explained by saying the unhidden pictures only act as reference points for the hidden ones.,Not really I was concentrating on trying to remeber the hidden image locations,Yes,Yes,Yes,"I would have a ""base"" hidden image of which I knew the location and then based everything around that i.e. image 1 I knew was in the middle, learnt that image 2 was up and left of that etc.",They helped purely as a physical reference point for the hidden images i.e. knew there was an image roughly in that area so go the left/right,The level of accuraccy required is very high! I was often just pixels away from the image and it raised as incorrect. maybe this would have been better if my screen was more zoomed in. Maybe you could implement a sizing step i.e. at the start make a box the same size as a credit card so that you know everyone is working from same position. I think had my screen been more zoomed I would have been more accurate/more room for error.

sub_101,The instructions were clear.,Yes.,Yes.,No.,No.,I focused on one of the stable visible pictures (always one on the left) and try to learn the non-visible pictures in relation to the position of the visible picture I was focusing on.,They always helped me.,No.
sub_102,All stages were very clear,"Yes, I noticed the boards moved which made it difficult",No. I didn't notice,"No, it tricked me",I did not even notice this,I would try to speak out loud using picture e.g jeans in bottom corner,"the visible pictures helped, the board moving did not","No, it was a good experiment"

sub_107,"The instructions were clear, I understood everything.","Yes I did, it was helpful in positioning.",I noticed that some stayed in position but I'm not sure how many.,I notice that some stayed in the same place and others moved but I don't know the numbers,I noticed some moved and others didn't though I'm not sure how many.,I ignored the visible pictures for the boards that had moving pictures as is confused me too much so I learnt where the hidden pictures were on memory alone.  However I did use the visible pictures on the blue board to help with positioning as they were stationary.,They helped on the blue board but I ignored them on all the others.  They didn't really hinder me as I just ignored them.,Maybe the board could have been a little bigger to make it easier to see the images.
sub_108,Yes all clear,No,No,No,No,I tried not to pay any attention to the first lot of photos because it didn't matter where they were because my task was to locate the hidden ones.,"I tried to ignore them so I guess that means they hindered me.

","Yes, I tried to apply somewhat of a link learning strategy. E.g. a stairway to heaven so it's near the top. Or, low slung jeans are low/near the bottom! I noticed I also kept being close to the location so would try and remind myself to budge closer to where my brain thought they'd be. When I noticed the coloured box hopping about, I started to see whether this position told me anything about where the item may be. E.g. if the inner box was more to the top/right etc. I couldn't see anything with this though.","This varied by board. At first I felt a bit thrown off by them, then I largely tried to ignore them, and later I used my eye to get a general sense of where things were to then increase my accuracy. Despite saying I didn't notice which were fixed in your questions above, I must have at points because sub-conciously some of my link learning brought in certain elements. E.g. what the squirrel was on top of...which I think was the pumpkin, but I may be wrong about this!",Not that I can think of!

Enjoyable nonetheless!
sub_125,clarify that you will have to learn the location of the pictures through trial and error,i think so ,i also think so ,yes,yes,"to move my mouse to the location if i made a miss and to idetify the location first visually on the blank board then move my mouse there, also to learn from where my common miss was then adjust ","depended on the board, but i think the bigger hindrence was how the board moves across the screen making it different to calibrate the exact location ",no
